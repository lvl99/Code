Here is a collection of jQuery plugins and projects I'm working on.


Roller v0.0.1
-----------------------------------------------
Roller is a carousel-esque plugin. It can be used for slideshows, and other such interactive slides. The roller plugin can take any number of children elements and the child elements themselves can be anything (i.e. images, block elements, iframes, etc.). It has many customisable features and can even build its own navigation.


Sticky v0.0.1
-----------------------------------------------
Sticky allows you to mark an element as 'sticky': when the user scrolls down, the element will 'stick' to a position. This is effective for keeping navigation on a long scrolling page. Currently only Y-axis scrolling is supported, but X-axis scrolling is easy enough so I'll chuck it in soon.


More to come?
-----------------------------------------------
I have a couple other plugins I want to work on and put here, so check back again soon!
